Climate change represents one of the most pressing global challenges of our era, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems, economies, and human well-being. The scientific consensus, supported by decades of research and data from organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide levels have risen from roughly 280 parts per million before the Industrial Revolution to over 420 parts per million today, trapping additional heat and driving a rise in global average temperatures.

The effects of this warming are already visible across the planet. Arctic sea ice is shrinking at an accelerating rate, glaciers are retreating on every continent, and sea levels have risen by approximately 20 centimetres since 1900. Extreme weather events, including more intense hurricanes, prolonged droughts, and devastating wildfires, are increasing in frequency and severity. Coral reefs, which support roughly a quarter of all marine species, are experiencing mass bleaching events that threaten biodiversity and the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on coastal fisheries.

Addressing climate change requires a coordinated global response spanning energy transition, land use reform, and technological innovation. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind have become cost-competitive with fossil fuels in many regions, and electric vehicle adoption is accelerating. Carbon capture and storage technologies are being developed to remove emissions directly from the atmosphere. International agreements like the Paris Accord set targets to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but meeting those targets will demand unprecedented political will and sustained investment from both the public and private sectors.
