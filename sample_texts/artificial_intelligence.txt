Artificial intelligence has rapidly evolved from a niche academic discipline into one of the most transformative technologies of the twenty-first century. Early AI research in the 1950s and 1960s focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based expert systems, but progress was slow and funding cycles oscillated between enthusiasm and so-called AI winters. The modern resurgence began in the 2010s, driven by three converging forces: the availability of massive datasets, dramatic increases in computing power through GPUs and cloud infrastructure, and breakthroughs in deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks and transformers.

Today, AI systems power a remarkable range of applications. Natural language processing models can translate between dozens of languages, summarise lengthy documents, answer questions, and generate human-like text. Computer vision algorithms identify objects in images and video with accuracy that rivals or exceeds human performance, enabling autonomous vehicles, medical imaging diagnostics, and industrial quality control. Reinforcement learning agents have mastered complex games like Go and StarCraft and are being applied to robotics, logistics optimisation, and drug discovery.

Despite these achievements, significant challenges remain. Large language models can produce plausible-sounding but factually incorrect outputs, a phenomenon often called hallucination. Bias in training data can lead to discriminatory outcomes in hiring, lending, and criminal justice applications. The energy consumption of training frontier models raises environmental concerns, and questions about intellectual property, privacy, and job displacement continue to spark intense policy debate worldwide. Researchers are actively working on alignment techniques, interpretability tools, and more efficient training methods to address these issues while ensuring that the benefits of AI are broadly shared.
