Space exploration has captivated human imagination for centuries, but the modern era of spaceflight began in earnest with the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union in 1957. The subsequent space race between the United States and the Soviet Union produced landmark achievements including the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin's orbital flight in 1961, and the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969. These early missions were driven largely by geopolitical competition, but they also yielded enormous scientific returns and inspired generations of engineers and scientists.

In recent decades, the landscape of space exploration has shifted dramatically. Government agencies like NASA, ESA, and CNSA continue to pursue ambitious programs, including the Artemis initiative to return humans to the Moon and eventually send crews to Mars. At the same time, private companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Rocket Lab have revolutionised the industry by developing reusable launch vehicles that have drastically reduced the cost of reaching orbit. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, for example, has been reflown dozens of times, and the company's Starship vehicle aims to make interplanetary travel economically feasible.

Beyond human spaceflight, robotic missions have expanded our understanding of the solar system and beyond. The James Webb Space Telescope is peering deeper into the universe than ever before, capturing images of galaxies formed shortly after the Big Bang. Mars rovers like Perseverance are searching for signs of ancient microbial life and collecting samples for future return to Earth. Missions to the outer planets and their moons, such as Europa Clipper, seek to determine whether subsurface oceans could harbour life. As technology advances and costs continue to fall, space exploration is entering a new golden age with the potential to answer some of humanity's most profound questions about our place in the cosmos.
